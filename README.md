# Vocalens: Talking Lens with YOLOv8

**Vocalens** is a real-time object detection and voice-assisted application that allows users to identify objects through their webcam using **YOLOv8**, with both **text and speech-based queries**. Inspired by Google Lens, this project provides instant visual recognition and natural language interaction entirely **locally**, without relying on external services or ADB.
